## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: Title

## Status
**Proposed** | **Accepted** | **Deprecated** | **Superseded**

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

### Positive
- ✅ Benefits

### Negative  
- ⚠️ Trade-offs

## Implementation
Key implementation details and locations.

## Related ADRs
Links to related decisions.

## References
Links to relevant documentation, code, or external resources.
```

## Guidelines

1. **Tightly constrained** - Each ADR should focus on a single architectural decision
2. **Context-driven** - Explain the problem that motivated the decision
3. **Consequence-aware** - Document both benefits and trade-offs
4. **Implementation-linked** - Reference actual code and tests
5. **Cross-referenced** - Link related ADRs together
